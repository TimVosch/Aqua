Conductivity Sensor
---

No special equipment is necessary for measuring conductivity in MicroSiemens.
fter all the arduino can measure 0.0 to 5.0 volts at the analog inputs. Using a simple circuit with a resistor and two probes in series,
we can measure the voltage drop over the resistor. That is the voltage *not* running over the two probes. We can then calculate the conductivity
over the two probes in siemens.
