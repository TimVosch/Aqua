# Prototype LoRaWAN 1 Basic Sending
This is our first prototype for a node to send data to the gateway.

## How to connect the node with the Arduino
Connect the pins as follow:

| RFM95W 	| Arduino 	|
|--------	|---------	|
| 3.3V   	| 3.3V    	|
| GND    	| GND     	|
| SCK    	| Pin 13  	|
| MISO   	| Pin 12  	|
| MOSI   	| Pin 11  	|
| CS/NSS 	| Pin 10  	|
| RESET  	| Pin 9   	|
| DIO2   	| Pin 6   	|
| DIO5   	| Pin 4   	|
| DIO1   	| Pin 3   	|
| DIO0   	| Pin 2   	|
