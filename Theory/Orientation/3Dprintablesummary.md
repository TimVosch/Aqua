# orientation on 3d-printable materials. 

For this project, we will be looking into 3d-printable materials, which suffices the following requirements:
- vandalism-proof, so it should be strong and sturdy
- temperature-resistant , so it must be resistant to at least -25℃ and +40 ℃
- weatherproof (rain, hail, frost, humidity)
- it must be waterproof, so it must be able to be submerged in extreme cases (there should be no leaks)
- it must be able to expand and shrink due to temperature differences
- it should not conduct electricity and heat, so the pcb's are safe

There are a lot of different materials which we can use, so we made a list of possible materials which are suitable for this project. 

##### Metals:
- titanium: 
the most versatile metal for 3D printing, because it's both strong and lightweight. Currently, it is the strongest 3d-printable on the market. It is mainly used in the medical industry (for prostectic joints), and in the aerospace industry and car industry for parts and prototypes. Titanium products are of high quality and are very durable, but titanium printing is not cheap , because it needs to be printed in an argon-filled industrial printer, because titanium powder is highly reactive. 

- stainless steel:
Stainless steel is the most affordable metal to 3d print. It is also very durable: it does not rust and corrode like normal steel does. It is very resistant to oxidation, acidic and basic enviroments, it is a bad conductor in electricity and the filaments used in 3d-printing are not magnetic. It is strong and can be infused with bronze, copper, carbon and chromium to change its properties to fit a better usage. Furthermore it is very elastic, which is fitting in enviroments which are influenced by large differences between temperatures. It can upstand temperatures up to 831 °C temperatures. During the 3d printing process, it needs to be in an argon-filled chamber to prevent oxidation. 

##### Plastics: 

- ABS:
ABS or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a thermoplastic polymer. It is resistant to high temperatures. It is cheap to produce and can easily be modified with any possible tool. It is mainly used as prototyping material in 3d-printing, because  yt is quite strong, mildly flexable and durable, which makes it a good material for printing prototypes. It is not resistant to water, since it attracts water molecules in the air. Due to the fact that it's made from petroleum, there will be toxic products released when it starts to degrade.It also degrades under high temperatures. One of the advantages is that ABS can be printed with every 3d printer on the market, so prototypes can be produced cheap and fast. 

- PLA:
PLA or Polylactic acid is a biodegradable thermopolymer made from sugar cane or corn stash. It is a renewable polymer, which makes is perfect for enviromental-friendly products and prototypes. It resembles ABS in a lot of ways. It has the same mechanical properties, so it's also strong, mildly flexable and durable. It can upstand to medium temperatures, not as high as ABS. It also attracts water, so it's not suited for end-products. It is more expensive, due to the fact that it's made from plants. It's only advantage over ABS is that it has the best printing speed. It can also be mixed with Aluminiun to create aluminide, which has the best properties of both. 

- PET:
PET or Polyethylene terephthalate, is known from plastic bottles. It is a strong, flexible and shockproof thermopolymer. It can withstand high temperatures. It is easy to recycle. It is a great product to use, because it can be printed with most home printers.
The costs of printing with PET are quite low, but ABS and PLA are cheaper.

- PC:
PC or Polycarbonate is by far the strongest thermopolymer used in the 3d-printing industry. It is widely used in the engineering world, reaching from the medical wing to the aerospace industry. It is higly resistant to anything you can throw at it, like water, heat, pressure etc. It can be biocompatible and can be sterilized, which makes it a great material for allmost all wings of the engineering world. It can withstand up to 300 °C and it will keep its strength under any circumstances. It's also a good electrical insulator and it is a flame retardant material. This is one of the best candidates for our project.
