- stainless steel:
Stainless steel is the most affordable metal to 3d print. It is also very durable: it does not rust and corrode like normal steel does. It is very resistant to oxidation, acidic and basic enviroments, it is a bad conductor in electricity and the filaments used in 3d-printing are not magnetic. It is strong and can be infused with bronze, copper, carbon and chromium to change its properties to fit a better usage. Furthermore it is very elastic, which is fitting in enviroments which are influenced by large differences between temperatures. It can upstand temperatures up to 831 C temperatures.

There’s a wide range of 3D printing materials out there so we decided to ask Yurii Yefimov from Gambody to help us with this 3D printing materials guide. Below he’ll describe various materials to help you make the best decision for what materials to use in desktop 3D printing.

What is ABS?

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is an petroleum­based polymer. ABS is very resistant to high temperature which makes it perfect for real­world components. It is a pretty cheap material allowing for cost­effective prototyping.

Features

ABS is available in a large array of colours which makes it popular among makers. Even the colorless ABS 3D printed object can be painted to any color. The material is mechanically strong, so you don’t have to worry about the lifespan of your model.
If you’re using ABS it is advised to print at 220° and 250°centigrade. To avoid bending and warping you will want to print with ABS on a heated bed (from 50° to 100°C) to ensure gradual cooling of the material. ABS gets a shiny, glossy look when processed with acetone vapour as this solution has the property to melt the upper layer of the printed object, making it smooth and shiny.
The biggest downfall of ABS is that it is a non­biodegradable toxic material that releases toxic fumes at high temperatures and smells awful.

Technical specifications

Melting temperature 200°C (392°F)
Density 1.05ρ(Mg/m3)
Glass transition temperature ~ 100°C
Autoignition temperature ~ 395°С
Wall thickness 1mm-2.5mm

ABS storage

Due to the fact that ABS and PLA materials attract water from the air, it is advised to store them in vacuum bags. Water that is absorbed from the air causes degradation of the material and it affects the print results.

What is PLA?

Made from renewable resources, Polylactic Acid is green 3d printing material. It has a moderate price point on the market and has various desirable properties and technical specifications which makes it the perfect 3D printer filament for hobbyists.

Features

PLA’s general print temperature is between 180° and 220°. It is a slightly flexible material, but it generates a smoother outer shell of the printed object. Due to the fact that it is made of corn starch, PLA is not toxic and releases a pleasant sweet smell. PLA is preferred for 3D printing smaller objects. However, the post­print processing of PLA objects is much more difficult than those printed in ABS.

Technical specifications

Melting temperature 155°C
Density 1.24g/m3
Glass transition temperature ~ 50°C
Autoignition temperature –
Wall thickness 1mm-2mm

PLA is available in a wide variety of blends such as wood, bamboo (mixing the standard plastic with fibers), copper, bronze (powder mix), and glowing effect (phosphorescent pigment).

PLA storage

Due to the fact that ABS and PLA materials attract water from the air, it is advised to store them in vacuum bags. Water that is absorbed from the air causes degradation of the material and it affects the print results.

What is Nylon (Polyamide)?

Nylon is a strong and durable synthetic polymer with a translucent silky finish, also called white plastic. It is also sold for a moderate price which makes it widely used for the production of household items.

Features

Nylon is a flexible material, with a natural white color, but it can be painted in any color with an acid­based dye. With nylon you can print moving parts, making it ideal for hobbyists. Although nylon prints have a somewhat rough surface, it can be smoothed out. It is recommended, however to avoid nylon for printing small elements as the smoothing procedure can damage them. Taulman 618, Taulman 645, and Bridge Nylon are the most popular types of material for 3D printing. Taulman 3D printing materials are known to have high inter­layer bonding, ensuring great durability and resistance of the printed model.

Technical specifications

Melting temperature 214°C-218°C
Density 1.05 g/cm3
Glass transition temperature 49.4°C-68.2°C
Autoignition temperature 343°C
Wall thickness 1mm

Storage Nylon

Just like PLA and ABS, Nylon material absorbs moisture from the air. This fact affects the quality of the print. Also, the moisture that gets absorbed by the material is the one to blame for the fumes released during printing. To avoid this, it is advised to store Nylon in airtight containers.

What is resin?

Resin is considered an advanced material that delivers the highest­quality output in 3D printing. It is hard, stiff and transparent and is suited for models requiring high detail and a smooth surface. It makes an ideal material for accurate models with limited functionality.

Features

Resin is a transparent material, with a blueish color. However, for a transparent color finish, pigment is added. The natural finishing of the model has some roughness, due to the support used in printing.

Storage

It is recommended to store resin material in dry conditions, at above 15° and below 30°C.

What is ceramics?

Ceramics as a printing material is made of fine ceramic powder which is sealed with a binder, like silica and porcelain.

Features

Ceramics is the first food­safe material, resistant to high heat (up to 500°C) and recyclable. As a food­safe product, it makes a perfect material for table wear, like cups, dishes, saucers, and figurines and toys. For the glossy finish the ceramic part is covered in glaze and kilned at about 1000°C to make it solid.

What is PET?

PET is short for PolyEthylene Terephtalate, and is a better choice than ABS.

Features

PET is a strong and flexible material, with a glossy finish. Due to its finish, it has found a place in 3D printing phone cases and wearables. The material is recyclable and does not release fumes or odors at high temperatures. The general print temperature ranges from 212° to 224°C. It is available in various colors and makes a great solution durable objects.

What is PVA and HIPS?

Polyvinyl Acetate and High Impact Polystyrene are two 3D printing materials used especially for support, as PVA is soluble in water which make removing PVA support from printed objects easy. HIPS is soluble in Limonene, which also facilitates support removal leaving the object clean without too much effort. PVA is not toxic although it releases some odor during printing. HIP is a recyclable material and it works best with ABS, as the two have similar features. Both materials used as support in 3D printing are pretty expensive.

Storage
The two materials absorb moisture from the air. That’s why it is recommended to keep them away from moisture sources prior to printing. Storing them in an airtight container will keep the materials dry.
