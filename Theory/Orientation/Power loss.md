Power loss
===
### What is power loss?
---
Power loss, also known as power outage, has a lot of causes. Examples are the circuit overloading or a cable that got damaged and is earthed. This causes the electric power to disappear, wich means there is no power to supply the circuit.

### What to when there is power loss?
---
There are of course many posibilties in how this power loss started. That's why the best thing to do is first check what the problem is. If you have figured it out then you can check on what to do. But this would cause alot of wasting time and you would have to walk al the way to the problem to fix it. So not the ideal option for a MFM.

### How to prevent a power loss?
---
So if solving it would take to much time, let's try to make it so there is no power loss in the first place. In the power network there is a really tight balance between normally and overloading. To protect your network from overloading there are a couple of options, such as: Fuses and protective relays. Their function is to check if there is an overload and instantly break, wich means the power network is disconnected and can't make a circuit, wich means there will be no power loss. The downside is that you will still need to go to the MFM to replace the fuse.  
### Conclusion
---
As of now there are no good ways to restore the power after a power outage from a distance. This would be ideal for MFM, if we could find a way to do that that would most defenitly be ideal.
