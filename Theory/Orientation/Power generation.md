Generating energy for the MFM
---

Generating (and storing) energy is one of the toughest things to do correct.

 - How can we ensure the MFM will have enough power to keep running?
 - What do we do when power is dangerously low?
 - Can we deliver continues power?

The first thing to pop in mind is a solar-panel. They're basically the future right? Let's see if there's more.

### How much power do we need?
Let's gather some basic information. In the Netherlands we've approximately _1637.8_ peak-hours of sunlight. Which is 18.70% of the time. _(That's not a lot)_  
The time it can charge has to compensate for the time it cannot, which can be done by delivering about 6 times more than it average consumes.

Assuming the MFM operates at 5.5 Volts and not more than 20 mA, the power would be 0.11 Watt which is about 27 times more than a 5 Watt solar panel delivers.

Whether this is applicable for the MFM depends on: the hours of sun per season, battery size, battery charge rate etc...  
This is definitely something to research more in-depth, as well as checking out real-life examples.
