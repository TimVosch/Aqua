### LoRa VS LoRaWAN ###

Libelium currently offers two options of this type of radio technology: LoRa and LoRaWAN  

 * LoRa: contains only the link layer protocol and is perfect to be used in P2P communications between nodes. LoRa modules are a little cheaper that the LoRaWAN ones. It works in the 868 and 900MHz bands. Go to the LoRa Tutorial.  
 * LoRaWAN: includes the network layer too so it is possible to send the information to any Base Station already connected to a Cloud platform. LoRaWAN modules may work in the 868/900/433MHz bands. Go to the LoRaWAN Tutorial.

- LOS: means that it is in plain sight so there are no buildings inbetween the 2 modules
- NLOS: means taht it is not in plain sight and that there is something like a building or a wall inbetween.

 ### Energy usage in mA? ###
---

### Libilium ###

The usage of a LoRa-Netork is 10 mA. The Arduino uses 9 mA, wich would mean we would have to double the power usage to implement the Lora-system.  
### XBee ###

- Supply Voltage	3.0 – 3.6 VDC  
- Transmit Current	500 mA typical at 3.3V (800 mA max)  
- Receive Current	65 mA typical  

### Conclusion ###
---
If u compare the Libilium and the XBee the libilium is by far the winner. Its costs way less is better in urban districts and uses alot less power. For the LoRa vs LoRaWAN, the best is the LoRaWAN because we can use the cerntral point to check in on all the other MFM. This way u can also update all the MFM at the same time. Furthermore, there is the option of maybe changing the frequentie of the measurement of the MFM.
