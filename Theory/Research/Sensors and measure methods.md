Sensors and measure methods
============================
For our project, we want an inventarisation of sensors in which you can find the function of each sensor and the way they measure, and some extra information regarding the specific sensor. With this inventarisation, we can choose the best possible sensors for our uses. 


#### Type of sensors
###### Water Level Sensors
There are multiple sensors we can use for the MFM. We want to find a sensor with low-power ussage.First we want to know more about the sensors. That's why we are going to inventarise on the sensors and meausure methods so we can make the best choice. 

The first sensor we have found, is the _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_
The _Manta 2 Water Quality Sondes_ are suitable for use in any natural water up to 50Â°C. It can be used as an unattended logger, used for spot testing and profiling with use of the Amphibian display unit / PDA or installed with wireless telemetry systems.
But what is a Amphibian display unit?
__The Amphibian display unit / PDA:__

The Amphibian is a handheld Pocket PC which provides an effective solution to field monitoring needs. It has a waterproof, chrushproof case which meets military standards and has a built in rechargeable battery pack. It is suitable for use with the Eureka Multiprobe.

The Eureka software provides everything you need for use in the field and allows you to quickly view and graph your data.

The easy to use Pocket PC allows the user to set up rolling displays of data, capture a data frame, start a timed log, and average the data readings. It comes with Pocket Word and Excel.

The users contacts and address book can be easily managed. When connected, data is automatically connected to your desktop.
Ideal applications for the _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_ include groundwater interaction, saltwater intrusion, surface water, reservoir and lake monitoring, estuary monitoring, watershed and source water protection, beach monitoring, storm water runoff, NPS monitoring, NPDES discharge, wastewater influent, effluent, vertical profiling, process water and aquaculture.

The _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_ is available in different sizes.

Parameter:  any of a set of physical properties whose values determine the characteristics or behavior of something <parameters of the atmosphere such as temperature, pressure, and density>

__Available parameters__
- Temperature
- Polargraphic (Clark) DO
- Optical DO
- Conductivity (SC)
- Salinity
- TDS
- Turbidity
- ORP
- pH
- Depth
- Level
- Ammonium
- Nitrate
- Chloride
- TDG
- Chlorophyll a
- Rhodamine
- Blue Green Algae

So as you can see, there are multiple parameters available. We are gonna need most of them probably,but first we want know which ones are the most important. 

####The details of the sensors:

#####Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor
The optical dissolved oxygen sensor has no replaceable membranes or caps and requires no circulator. It provides exceptional accuracy and uses luminescent dissolved oxygen technology. It is insensitive to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) compared to polargraphic DO sensors and is not damaged by sunlight.

#####Turbidity Sensor
The turbidity sensor is highly accurate up to 3000NTU's. It has a self cleaning wiper that is user programable up to 5 wipes to remove biological growth or debris.

#####Chlorophyll a Sensor
The Chlorophyllsensor accurately measures in 3 ranges from 0.03 to 500 ug/L. It has ambient light and turbidity rejection circuitry and fast response time and compact design. An adjustable secondary standard is available for calibration and quick check.

#####Blue-Green Algae Sensor
The Blue-Green Algae sensor accurately measures in 3 ranges from 0 - 2,000,000 cells/mL Cyanobacteria (phycocyanin or phycoerythrin). It identifies potential algae blooms and provides substantial cost savings by eliminating cell counting.

#####Rhodamine WT Sensor
The Rhodamine WT Sensor measures accurately in 3 ranges from 0.04 to 1000 ppb. It is available with a secondary standard for quick and accurate calibration. Accurate readings and a fast response time are ensured with its ambient light rejection and fast response time. Small sample size volume design and high quality optics provide turbidity rejection

#####Depth
Depth sensors are available in 5 ranges from 0 - 200 meters in absolute or vented. It has automatic temperature and salinity compensation.

#####Temperature Sensor
The temperature sensor is a 30k ohm thermistor and has a 316 Stainless Steel housing. The temperature sensor is used to provide compensation for Specific Conductance, Dissolved Oxygen, pH, and Ion Selective Electrodes.
pH Sensor
The pH sensor is easily maintained. It has a rebuildable reference with PTFE/FEP Junction so there is no sensor to replace.

#####Conductivity Sensor
A very accurate sensor for measuring conductivity, specific conductance, salinity and TDS. It requires virtually no maintenance and is accurate up to 100,000 uS/cm. It automatically compensates temperature.

#####Dissolved Oxygen Sensor
The Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (Polargraphic) has been the standard in the industry for 30 years. Its circulator provides a fast response time in low flow or stagnant waters. No "reconditioning" of the sensor is necessary.

#####Ammonium
The Ammonia Ion Selective Electrode with replaceable plasticized tips and has a maximum depth of 25 meters. It provides automatic calculation of ammonia and total ammonia concentrations. It is designed for agricultural industry and fertiliser runoff in fresh water. Ammonia ISE's will not work in sea water and interfering ions will effect reading.

#####Chloride
The Chloride Ion Selective Electrode with replaceable plasticized tips and has a maximum depth of 25 meters. It is ideal for measurement of saltwater intrusion or as an effective tracer for pollution.

#####Nitrate Ion Selective Electrodes
The Nitrate Ion Selective Electrode with replaceable plasticized tips and has a maximum depth of 25 meters. It provides automatic correction of temperature and automatic compensation for ionic strength concentrations.

We've then found a system which comes close to our idea for the MFM. It's called Libelium Smart Water. It's a system which can measure multiple ions. You can check water quality, the ions in a swimming pool etc. 
It's exactly what we need except for the system itself. We only need the sensors, but these sensors are made for the Smart Water board. 
We are going to check if we can use the sensors individually. 

Still, we are going to analyse the system. Maybe we can find something we also can use in the MFM. 

| Key Features         | Why it Matters       |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Sensor probes measure more than 12 chemical and physical water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity (salinity), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, temperature, etc.	| Pollutants can be detected and treated in real-time, to ensure good water quality over an entire water supply network. Extreme pH values may indicate chemical spills, treatment plant issues, or problems in supply pipes. Low levels of DO may indicate the presence of microorganisms due to urban/agricultural runoff or sewage spills. ORP measures how well water sanitization is working. |
| The new Ions are: Fluoride (F-), Calcium (Ca2+) , Nitrate (NO3-), Chloride (Cl-), Iodide (I-),  Cupric (Cu2+), Bromide (Br-),  Silver (Ag+),  Fluoroborate (BF4-), Ammonia [NH4],  Lithium [Li+], Magnesium [Mg2+],  Nitrite [NO2-],  Perchlorate [ClO4],  Potassium [K+], Sodium [Na+] | Specific applications include: Drinking water quality control: Calcium (Ca2+), Iodide (I-), Chloride (Cl-), Nitrate (NO3-), pH, Agriculture water monitoring: Calcium (Ca2+), Nitrate (NO3-), pH, Swimming pools: Bromide (Br-), Chloride (Cl-), Fluoride (F-), pH, Waste water treatment: Cupric (Cu2+), Silver (Ag+), Fluoroborate (BF4-), pH, Firsh Farming / Fish Tank Monitoring / Hatchery / Aquaculture / Aquaponics: Measuring the water conditions of aquatic animals such as    snails, fish, crayfish, shrimps or prawns in tanks. Important values are pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Ammonia (NH4), Nitrate (NO3-), Nitrite (NO2-) and water temperature. |
| Waspmote transmits sensor readings to the Cloud via 3G, GPRS, or WCDMA cellular connections; in the case of several nodes located in the same zone, Waspmote sends values to the Meshlium Internet Gateway via long range RF bands 868MHz and 900MHz.	| Sensor data is available in real time, even from sensor nodes situated in remote locations.
| Battery powered, low power requirements. | Because no wiring is necessary Waspmote installation takes just minutes and can provide remote monitoring for years. 
| CE / FCC /IC certification and quad-band connectivity (850/900/1900/2100MHz) | Waspmote supports any cellular connection provider, and is ready for deployment in any country in the world |

These are the technical specifications from the Libelium Smart Water system. It's already low powered, but we are aiming for even a lower power ussage.
