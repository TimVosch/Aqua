Sensors and measure methods
============================
We need to know for our project, which sensors and measure methods are the best and what the function of each sensor and meausure method is. 

There are a few type of sensors which are used for the water. We are gonna explain every type of (water)sensor and give some information about it.

#### Type of sensors
###### Water Level Sensors

Level sensors are used to detect the level of substances that can flow. Such substances include liquids, slurries, granular material and powders. Level measurements can be done inside containers or it can be the level of a river or lake. Such meaurements can be used to determine the amount of materials within a closed container or the flow of water in open channels.
You have just read that this type of sensor can be used by a river/ sea.It can possibly be used in the MFM, but first we wanna know how many water level sensors there are and how much power they use.
