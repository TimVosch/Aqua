Sensors and measure methods
============================
For our project, we want an inventarisation of sensors in which you can find the function of each sensor and the way they measure, and some extra information regarding the specific sensor. With this inventarisation, we can choose the best possible sensors for our uses. 


#### Type of sensors
###### Water Level Sensors
There are multiple sensors we can use for the MFM. We want to find a sensor with low-power ussage.First we want to know more about the sensors. That's why we are going to inventarise on the sensors and meausure methods so we can make the best choice. 

The first sensor we have found, is the _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_
The _Manta 2 Water Quality Sondes_ are suitable for use in any natural water up to 50Â°C. It can be used as an unattended logger, used for spot testing and profiling with use of the Amphibian display unit / PDA or installed with wireless telemetry systems.
But what is a Amphibian display unit?
__The Amphibian display unit / PDA:__

The Amphibian is a handheld Pocket PC which provides an effective solution to field monitoring needs. It has a waterproof, chrushproof case which meets military standards and has a built in rechargeable battery pack. It is suitable for use with the Eureka Multiprobe.

The Eureka software provides everything you need for use in the field and allows you to quickly view and graph your data.

The easy to use Pocket PC allows the user to set up rolling displays of data, capture a data frame, start a timed log, and average the data readings. It comes with Pocket Word and Excel.

The users contacts and address book can be easily managed. When connected, data is automatically connected to your desktop.
Ideal applications for the _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_ include groundwater interaction, saltwater intrusion, surface water, reservoir and lake monitoring, estuary monitoring, watershed and source water protection, beach monitoring, storm water runoff, NPS monitoring, NPDES discharge, wastewater influent, effluent, vertical profiling, process water and aquaculture.

The _Manta 2 Water Quality Sonde_ is available in different sizes.
