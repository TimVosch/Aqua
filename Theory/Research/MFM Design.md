#### Requirements for our design
- it needs to be able to withstand all weather and temperature conditions without harm to the electronics.
- it needs to be vandalism-proof
- it needs to be self-sufficient for approx. 1 year
- it needs to be modular, so every sensor must be able to be attached to our system without too much trouble. 
- The solar panel powering our system must be placed at a certain angle to obtain maximum energy to charge its batteries and to power its system
