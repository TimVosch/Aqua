# Requirements for our design
The following points will be a combination of multiple documents written by all group members. They will be added here to decide which of these points are possible to achieve with the recourses we have. We have come up with the following points: 

- The solar panel powering our system must be placed at a certain angle to obtain maximum energy to charge its batteries and to power its system
- the prototype needs to be able to communicate over the LoRa network
- the prototype needs to be self-sufficient for approx. 1 year 
- the prototype needs to be able to withstand all weather and temperature conditions without harm to the electronics.
- the prototype needs to be vandalism-proof
- the prototype needs to be modular, so every sensor must be able to be attached to our system without too much trouble. 
- there must be a functional network supporting the devices and it needs to gather the data in a central point where the data can be viewed and processed. 
 

## Optimum solar panel placement
We will start with this, since it will influence our entire design, because it will be the main supply of power (along with the battery). 
 To get the most from solar panels, you need to point them in the direction that captures the most sun. But there are a number of variables in figuring out the best direction. 

This advice applies to any type of panel that gets energy from the sun; photovoltaic, solar hot water, etc. We assume that the panel is fixed, or has a tilt that can be adjusted seasonally. (Panels that track the movement of the sun throughout the day can receive 10% (in winter) to 40% (in summer) more energy than fixed panels. 

Solar panels should always face true south if you are in the northern hemisphere, or true north if you are in the southern hemisphere. True north is not the same as magnetic north. If you are using a compass to orient your panels, you need to correct for the difference, which varies from place to place. 

The next question is, at what angle from horizontal should the panels be tilted? Books and articles on solar energy often give the advice that the tilt should be equal to your latitude, plus 15 degrees in winter, or minus 15 degrees in summer. It turns out that you can do better than this - about 4% better. 

##### Fixed or ajustable
It is simplest to mount your solar panels at a fixed tilt and just leave them there. But because the sun is higher in the summer and lower in the winter, you can capture more energy during the whole year by adjusting the tilt of the panels according to the season. The following table shows the effect of adjusting the angle, using a system at 40° latitude as an example. (The comparison would be a little different for different latitudes.) Each option is compared with the energy received by the best possible tracker that always keeps the panel pointed directly at the sun. 

Table 1: 
![alt text] (https://github.com/TimVosch/Aqua/blob/master/Theory/Media/table%201.png "Logo Title Text 1") 


In short, adjusting the tilt twice a year gives you a meaningful boost in energy. Adjusting four times a year produces only a little more, but could be important if you need to optimize production in spring and fall

The graph (1) below shows the effect of adjusting the tilt. The turquoise line shows the amount of solar energy you would get each day if the panel is fixed at the full year angle. The red line shows how much you would get by adjusting the tilt four times a year as described below. For comparison, the green line shows the energy you would get from two-axis tracking, which always points the panel directly at the sun. (The violet line is the solar energy per day if the panel is fixed at the winter angle, discussed below.) These figures are calculated for 40° latitude. 
Graph 1:

##### Fixed tilt
If your solar panels will have a fixed tilt angle, and you want to get the most energy over the whole year, then this section is for you. A fixed angle is convenient, but note that there are some disadvantages. As mentioned above, you’ll get less power than if you adjusted the angle. Also, if you live where there is snow, adjusting the panels to a steeper angle in winter makes it more likely that they will shed snow. A panel covered in snow produces little or no power.

Use one of these formulas to find the best angle from the horizontal at which the panel should be tilted: 
- If your latitude is below 25°, use the latitude times 0.87
- If your latitude is between 25° and 50°, use the latitude, times 0.76, plus 3.1 degrees

This table (2) gives some examples for different latitudes. It also shows the average insolation on the panel over the year (in kWh/m2 per day), and the energy received compared to the best possible tracker

:Table 2 ![alt text] (https://github.com/TimVosch/Aqua/blob/master/Theory/Media/table%202.png "Logo Title Text 3")

If you want to adjust the angle of your panels twice a year, you should follow the table (3) below for the best dates of change:

: Table 3: ![alt text] (https://github.com/TimVosch/Aqua/blob/master/Theory/Media/table%203.png "Logo Title Text 4")
If your latitude is between 25° and 50°, then the best tilt angle for summer is the latitude, times 0.93, minus 21 degrees. The best tilt angle for winter is the latitude, times 0.875, plus 19.2 degrees

The best option for our situation would be to leave it at the winter angle, because our need for energy will be higher in winter. Although you could get more energy during other seasons by adjusting the tilt, you will get enough energy without making any adjustment. The following tables( 4) assume that the tilt is set at the winter optimum all year long. They show the amount of insolation (in kWh/m2) on the panel each day, averaged over the season. 

: table 4: ![alt text] (https://github.com/TimVosch/Aqua/blob/master/Theory/Media/table%204.png "Logo Title Text 4")

It is also possible to change the angle 4 times a year, but that is far from ideal in our situation so we won't be going in further on that option. 

##### further explanation
These calculations are based on an idealized situation. They assume that you have an unobstructed view of the sky, with no trees, hills, clouds, dust, or haze ever blocking the sun.

You may need to make adjustments for your situation. For example, if you have trees to the east but not the west, it may be better for you to aim your solar panels slightly to the west. Or if you often have clouds in the afternoon but not the morning, you might aim your panels slightly to the east.

The calculations also assume that you are near sea level. At very high altitude, the optimum angle could be a little different.

If you are estimating energy output, remember that temperature affects the efficiency of photovoltaic panels. They produce less power at higher temperatures. Panels vary so you will need to contact your panel manufacturer for their specifications.

For each configuration of latitude and season, over 12,000 data points were calculated for various times throughout the day and the year. For each data point, the equations of celestial mechanics were used to determine the height and azimuth of the sun. The intensity of the sun was corrected to account for the increased absorption by the atmosphere when the sun is lower in the sky, using the formula:

intensity in kw/m2 = 1.35 * (1.00/1.35) sec(angle of sun from zenith)

This formula assumes that the earth is flat, so a factor was applied to account for the curvature of the earth (and therefore the earth’s atmosphere). These factors, and the angle of the sun with respect to the panel, then determine the insolation on the panel. An iterative method then determined the angles that give the maximum total insolation during each season. Given those angles, the beginning and ending dates of the season were then adjusted to the optimum, then the angles recalculated, until the process converged. After the optimum dates and angles were calculated, it was determined that a linear formula closely approximates the optimum. The formulas are only accurate within the specified range.

Other published articles on tilt angles have used less accurate calculations. For example, Richard Perez and Sam Coleman, in “PV Module Angles”, Home Power n.34 p.14-16, 1993, recommend an angle that puts the panel perpendicular to the sun’s rays at noon. That is indeed the best angle at noon on that day, but it does not take into account the best angle for capturing solar energy at other times of the day. That article also leaves it to the reader to estimate the best angle over the period until the next time the tilt is adjusted.

## power supply
Out battery needs to be able to store power from a solar panel and it needs to supply power to our system if there is not enough power to supply our system with enough electricity to function. There are multiple possibilities which have good specification to fit our needs, but some of them have some flaws which makes them unsuitable for usage.

### Comparison list
![alt text] (https://github.com/TimVosch/Aqua/blob/master/Theory/Media/battery%20comparrison.png "Logo Title Text 4")


### Lead-acid based batteries
#### lead-acid battery
Lead acid batteries are widely uses in the industry of batteries. It is the oldest rechargable battery type. Despite having a low power to mass ratio and a low volume to energy ratio, is has a relatively high power to weight ratio. It doesn't cost a lot of money to produce. The battery consists of PbSo4 plates as the 2 electrodes and they are surrounded by sulfuric acid. They work like a normal eletrochemical cell and electrolytical cell, with 2 reactions per electrode. 
It has multiple uses like :
- starting cars
- powering electric vehichles
- usable as uninterrupted power supply (UPS) and off-grid power storage
- marine appliances
It has 3 cycle modes to support a variable usage of this battery type. 
However , it has its downsides, which makes it unsuitable for our situation: 
- it needs to be refilled with sulfuric acid once every 6 months, this is due to the fact that the sulfuric acid vaporises when the battery charges
- The battery's capacity slowly uses it's storage capacity, because the sulfate sticks to the electrodes and minimalises their surface area
- It is possible that gases are created during the charging state if it is used exessively. This can cause explosions in the battery. 
- If the battery can't let the gases escape, then there will be corrosion due to acid gases in the battery. This results in the formation of crystals in the sulfuric acid solution, which interferes with the battery's performance. 
these things only happen if the battery is discharged to 0% and if it's overcharged. If you keep it at approx 50% charged, you'll only need to refill the battery once every 6 months, so it still is unsuitable for our purposes. 

### AGM and Gell battery
I took these 2 together since they are almost identical, with only small differences. To make it easier for myself, i have combined these 2 below: 

#### AGM Batteries

AGM stands for Absorbed Glass Mat, which is a unique mat deliberately designed to trap the electrolyte between the plates inside the battery. This type of battery is also commonly referred to as a VRLA battery, which stands for Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid battery. Unlike wet batteries, AGM batteries only hold a small amount acid to help keep the mat wet. This is a major safety feature that prevents acid from leaking if the battery breaks. AGM batteries are normally referred to as “all-purpose batteries” due to their wide range of applications, such as emergency lights, alarm and security systems, EPS and UPS.

#### Gel Batteries

Gel batteries contain a specially formulated paste, silica gel, where the battery electrolyte are trapped in. Unlike AGM batteries, Gel batteries allow the electrons to flow between plates. However, Gel batteries are similar to AGM batteries in the sense that they are both non-spillable if the battery breaks. The most common applications for Gel batteries include: renewable energy, medical equipment, golf trolleys, garden equipment and traffic lights.

 
#### Life expectancy

Battery life expectancy is not measured by a year count. Rather, it is measured by the number of times it can be charged and discharged. This is referred to as the battery’s cycle life. Both AGM and Gel batteries are recommended to always be fully charged when possible, and not to be discharged lower than 50%. However, Canbat (=the brand i researched) batteries have one of the highest cycle life in the lead-acid battery industry, and they can be discharged up to 60% without causing the battery any harm.

All-purpose AGM batteries have a cycle life of 500 cycles at a 50% depth of discharge. This means that an AGM battery can be charged and discharged 500 times. If the battery is charged and discharged once a day, an AGM battery can last for 500 days, which is roughly a year and a half, at full capacity. After 500 cycles, the battery will still work but at a lower capacity, meaning that it will not give you the same amount of energy as before.

Gel batteries work in the same manner, but they have a much higher cycle life of 1,200 cycles, at a 50% depth of discharge. If a Canbat Gel battery is charged and discharged once a day, it can last for 1,200 days, which is about 3 years and 5 months. Having a relatively high battery cycle life is one of the most striking features of a Gel battery.

The only differece between these 2 is the price and quality: The Gell battery has a much higher price, but it comes with a bigger life expectancy than the AGM battery. 

#### Advantages of gel/AGM batteries over normal lead-acid batteries: 
- Unlike flooded/unsealed batteries, SLAs require no maintenance beyond proper charging.
- Unlike FLAs, when being charged SLAs produce no gasses that must be vented.
- SLAs work well with small solar arrays and can be charged to lower voltages as lower charge rates.
- No water must ever be added and individual batteries will not need to be equalized to ensure proper operation of the overall system.
- SLAs don’t leak or suffer terminal corrosion.
- The most commonly used type of SLA, Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM), is non-hazardous, and can be shipped between locations without precaution or extra expense.
- SLAs are easily stackable and will take up less space in a battery bank than other alternatives.


#### Advantages of the lead-acid battery over the AGM/Gel battery
- FLA's are cheaper
- FLA's are widely available in all shapes and size

(SLA = sealed lead-acid battery, such as the AGM and gel types)
(FLA = Flooded lead-acid battery, the normal ones)

The AGM battery is currently the best option from the lead-acid based batteries, because it hits the sweetspot between price, performance and maintanance. It is able to withstand temperatures between -20 and +50, it doesn't require maintanance if charged correctly, it can come in any shape or form, it can provide enough power to be able to keep the device turned on at all times. So the AGM battery is our favourite pick at the moment from these 3 types

### Lithium-based batteries
Lithium-based batteries have 2 things in common, they're lightweight and they have a very high power/weight ratio, meaning that they provide a lot of power.  We are going to look at the 2 best options for our device, which are the lithium polymer battery and the lithium iron phosphate battery .
Lithium-ion, Lithium Polymer and Lithium Iron Phosphate

Lithium batteries provide the highest capacity (ampere-hours or "Ah") per unit weight of all metals, making it an ideal material for a lithium anode. Lithium battery pack systems offer distinct advantages over other battery systems, especially with respect to long life, reliability and capacity.


A lithium power source offers a significant advantage if:

- A high voltage is needed (i.e. 3.0 to 3.9 volts per cell)
- A recharging circuit is not available or too costly
- The power source has to be as light weight as possible
- Long shelf life is required
- A wide temperature range is required
- Reliability is crucial
- Extremely high energy density is needed
- Environmental concerns such as temperature, vibration or shock are especially severe
- Your application demands a continuous source of power for extensive periods of time

Li-Ion and Li-Polymer battery packs should always be used with a protection circuit to prevent the cell from over charging or over dis-charging. Choosing the correct circuit and applying it appropriately is vital to the longevity your batteries and your own safety.

Lithium iron Phosphate based batteries possesses superior thermal and chemical stability which provides better safety characteristics than those of Lithium-ion technology made with other cathode materials. Lithium phosphate cells are incombustible in the event of mishandling during charge or discharge, they are more stable under overcharge or short circuit conditions and they can withstand high temperatures without decomposing. When abuse does occur, the phosphate based cathode material will not burn and is not prone to thermal runaway. Phosphate chemistry also offers a longer cycle life, so lifepo4 batteries are safer to use than lithium polymer. However, lithium iron phosphate batteries are heavier than lithium polymer batteries, due to lower power to weight ratios

So overall, the litium iron phosphate has the most advantages: 
- it can operate between -20 and +40 during charging and discharging
- it has a very high power to weigt ratio, almost 5 times the weight/power ratio of lead-acid batteries
- it has its own safety measurements to prevent overcharging and overheating
- it can provide sufficient voltages to power the system we have
- it isn't very expensive, about €1,-/kH
- it is possible to build this type of battery in several shapes to fit in our housing
However, the battery might need insulation to keep working in subzero temperatures

lithium iron phosphate specs:

- Min. discharge voltage = 2.5V [14]
- Working voltage = 3.0 ~ 3.3 V
- Max. charge voltage = 3.65V
- Volumetric energy density = 220 Wh/dm3 (790 kJ/dm3)
- Gravimetric energy density > 90 Wh/kg[15] (> 320 J/g)
- 100% DOD cycle life (number of cycles to 80% of original capacity) = 2,000–7,000[16]
- 10% DOD cycle life (number of cycles to 80% of original capacity) > 10,000 [17]
- Sony Fortelion: 71% capacity after 8,000 cycles with 100% DOD[18]
- Cathode composition (weight)
- 90% C-LiFePO4, grade Phos-Dev-12
- 5% Carbon EBN-10-10 (superior graphite)
- 5% PVDF
Cell configuration:

- Carbon-coated aluminium current collector 15
- 1.54 cm2 cathode
- Electrolyte: Ethylene carbonate-Dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) 1-1 LiClO4 1M
- Anode: Graphite or Hard Carbon with intercalated Metallic lithium
Experimental conditions:

- Room temperature
- Voltage limits: 2.0–3.65 V
- Charge: Up to C/1 rate up to 3.6 V, then constant voltage at 3.6 V until I < C/24
- According to the manufacturer BYD the lithium iron phosphate battery of the electric car e6 is charged at a fast charging station within 15 minutes to 80%, after 40 minutes at 100%

However, LiFePO4 batteries are way too expensive for our budget, so we need to go with the second best choice, which is the lithium polymer battery. The LiPo battery has the same specs as the LiFePo4 battery , but they lack several safety features which the lifepo4 battery has, such as temperature resistance, overcharging protection etc. So our final choice will be the LiPo, the second best battery of our research. We will have to insulate them well to work in subzero temperatures, but they are cheaper than lifepo4 batteries and we will eventually save money with this choice. 
## Expected power usage
We will be using the arduino uno v3 for our project. 
These are the specifications :
Microcontroller: ATmega328
Operating Voltage: 5V
Input Voltage (recommended):	7-12V
Input Voltage (limits):	6-20V
Digital I/O Pins: 14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)
Analog Input Pins: 6
DC Current per I/O Pin: 40 mA
DC Current for 3.3V Pin: 50 mA
Flash Memory: 32 KB (ATmega328) of which 0.5 KB used by bootloader
SRAM: 2 KB (ATmega328)
EEPROM: 1 KB (ATmega328)
Clock Speed:	16 MHz
Note that the Arduino has a minimal recommended input of 7v, and a maximum recommended input of 12v, so we need to have a battery that provides constant 7-12v to out power circuit. 

Let's gather some basic information about the energy that will be gained with the solar panels. In the Netherlands we've approximately 1637.8 peak-hours of sunlight. Which is 18.70% of the time. (That's not a lot)
To compensate for the time there is no sun, we will have to deliver 100/18.70 = 5.4 times more power than it consumes in optimal conditions.
A basic solar panel is around 5 Watts, which means they deliver around 5/0.11 = 27 times more than we consume, again in optimal conditions.
Assuming the MFM operates at 5.5 Volts and not more than 20 mA, the power would be 0.11 Watt. This would be 

### Reasons why we should get a triangle-shaped model
- Optimal strength , force applied to the model will be divided over the entire structure because of the triangle shape, thus making it very resistance to vandalism and weather-based influences
- Optimal length and width for sensor on the bottom of the model to measure the water below, without becoming a victim of vandalism
- Optimal angle for maximum solar power generation. An angle of 36 degrees will get us the most energy 
- More surface area than other shapes. A triangle has 2 surface areas to capture the largest amount of sunlight throughout the day, while rectangular shapes can only be used for shorter timespans 
- The structure of the triangle can support itself with 1 attachement on the support beam, while rectangles need 2 or more attachements to the support beam
- The triangular shape is easier to insulate and has a lower chance of leakage

Additional calculation: As you asked about the strength of a triangular shape then let me introduce to the triangular chain consisting of three rigid links or bars connected to each other by pin joints(allowing rotation between two joined links) .

The degree of freedom (n) of a plane chain is given by the Grasshoff's law as
n=3(l−1)−2j−h
n=3(l−1)−2j−h
for a triangular chain we have
l=no. of links=3
l=no. of links=3
j=no. of binary joints=3
j=no. of binary joints=3
h=no. of higher pairs=0
h=no. of higher pairs=0
Hence, we get
n=3(3−1)−2(3)−0=6−6=0
n=3(3−1)−2(3)−0=6−6=0
The degree of freedom of the triangular chain (equivalent to plane triangular shape) has zero degree of freedom this indicates that links of the triangular chain can't move even a bit if links are strong enough even under the application of external forces.

Thus a triangular shape is the strongest one which is also called a rigid structure. It is also called a perfect frame in physical structures.

## Design
We have concluded that the triangular shape is the best shape for our model. We need to take several other things in account, like: 
- an angle of 36 degrees to get maximum solar power throughout the day
- A maxiumum heigt of 15 cm
- The sensors need to reach the water in all spots, so it needs to be long and it needs to reach far from the place of attachement
- it needs to be strong and rigid to sustain damage from vandalism and weather

We went to sketchup to make a model which would suit all of our needs. It would also provide the measurements we need to produce a functional 3d model. 
We started with a attachement panel with a height and width of 15 cm to get a maximum surface to attach it to a wall or support beam. Then we calculated the length needed to get 36 degree angle, which was 21 cm. So our ground panel is 21x15cm.  Then we drew the side panels which where a = 16,5 , b= 22,5 and C = 28 cm. 
We drew them on paper to get a better image of what we are talking about.
