Sensors Research 
================
After a little bit of general research, we are going to investigate which sensors are the best option for our MFM.
Recently we have visited Mr. Goossens again and he told us which sensors are most important. 
The conductivity sensor, depth/ ultrasone sensor and a pH-sensor. These are very important to measure the quality of water.
Now we have this information, we are going to look which sensors have the lowest power ussage and if we can use them with Arduino.
In this file, you will find every sensor we have researched and if it's usable with Arduino. 

#### Conductivity sensor
It's quite difficult to find a conductivity sensor which can be used with Arduino. What I did find is an explanation about a conductivity sensor implementation in Arduino --> http://www2.latech.edu/~dehall/LWTL/ENGR121/notes/3_conductivity_sensor_intro.pdf 

It may be handy to use this file when we have found a conductivity sensor.

#####1. Gravity: Analog Electrical Conductivity Sensor / Meter For Arduino
The first sensor I found and can be used with Arduino, is the Gravity: Analog Electrical Conductivity Sensor / Meter for Arduino.

It's important to know the conductivity of water, because it reflects the level of electrolytes present in the water. 
Depending on the concentration of the electrolyte, the conductivity of the aqueous solution is different. It's a special meter, because it's special-built for Arduino and has practical features. When the meter is installed, you can measure the Conductivity easily.
