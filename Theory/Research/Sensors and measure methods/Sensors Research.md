Sensors Research 
================
After a little bit of general research, we are going to investigate which sensors are the best option for our MFM.
Recently we have visited Mr. Goossens again and he told us which sensors are most important. 
The conductivity sensor, depth/ ultrasone sensor and a pH-sensor. These are very important to measure the quality of water.
Now we have this information, we are going to look which sensors have the lowest power ussage and if we can use them with Arduino.
In this file, you will find every sensor we have researched and if it's usable with Arduino. 

#### Conductivity sensor
It's quite difficult to find a conductivity sensor which can be used with Arduino. What I did find is an explanation about a conductivity sensor implementation in Arduino --> http://www2.latech.edu/~dehall/LWTL/ENGR121/notes/3_conductivity_sensor_intro.pdf 
It may be handy to use this file when we have found a conductivity sensor
