# Aqua - Multiflexmeter

Welcome to the _Aqua_ repository. This repository is a whole project, this means that it contains Orientation, Research, Design, and development files instead of just the latter.

The Multiflexmeter (_MFM_) is a small modulair device that is placed near waters to measure: _Water height, speed, temperature, consistency etc..._
Ofcourse not all of this has to be measured everywhere, that's where the modulair property of the MFM comes in play, it allows for a plug-and-play style sensor equipping and will start transferring data immediatly.
